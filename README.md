This project helps you operate a computerized microscope using a controller, natively from your browser.

It relies on the WebHID API for Dualsense controller support (USB or bluetooth), and the Web Serial API to communicate with a Marlin-style CNC device.

### Goals

- Fun to use
- Easy to use
- Open source

### Why?

> The want of some concise, yet sufficiently comprehensive, popular account of the Microscope, both as regards the management and manipulation of the instrument, and the varied wonders and hidden realms of beauty that are disclosed and developed by its aid.<br/>**Jabez Hogg**, _The Microscope: Its History, Construction, and Application_, 1854

> And the belief that many who possess microscopes are deterred from attempting any branch of original investigation solely by the great difficulty they experience surmounting elementary detail and mere mechanical operations.<br/>**Lionel Smith Beale**, _How To Work With The Microscope_, 1857

In other words,

> Maybe folks would appreciate microscopes if they were more fun, and easy to use.<br/>**Lionel & Jabez**, _probably_, circa 1850

Ideally, it would be like there was _no scope_ at all.

### But where do I get the microscope?

It will need to be built from scratch. A 3D printer would be a good starting point; confirm that it responds to the tool, then swap the extruder for your objective lens and camera. Godspeed.
